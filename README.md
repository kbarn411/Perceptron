# Perceptron
My implementation of simple perceptron in Python from scratch. Only dependency is pyyaml for setting file

## Short description
Data are processed and perceptron is trained in a way:
- reading data from csv file
- split data into train and validation
- normalizing data
- random initialization of weights
- gradient algorithm used to optimize weights
- denormalizing data to show predictions for val set

## Example Dataset
For demonstration purpose dataset of simple addition of integers is provided. Goal is to teach perceptron how to add numbers
